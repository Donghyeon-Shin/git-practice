## âœ¨Git 
![](https://git-scm.com/images/logo@2x.png)
Git is a distributed version management system for tracking changes in computer files
and coordinating the operations of those files among multiple users.
Software development is primarily used for source code management, 
but can be used to continuously track changes in any set of files.

### Directory

- pwd : shows the current path in a hierarchical directory
- cd : change directory
    - cd path : Move to the designated path
- ls : list files and directories
    - /bin : List the files in the /bin diretory
    - -l : List the files in the working directory in long format
    - -l /etc /bin : List the fiels in the /bin and /etc directory in long format
    - -la : List all files (Including normally hidden files)

### Manipulation
- cp : copt files and directories
    - file 1 file 2 : copies the contents of file 1 into file 2 / does not exist, it is created
    - -i file 1 file 2 : if file 2 exists, the user is prompted before it is overwritten with the contents of file 1
    - file dir : copy the contents of file1 inside of directory dir.
    - -R dir1 dir2 : copy the contents of the directory dir1. / directory dir2 does not exist, it is created
- mv : move files and directories or rename them
    - file 1 file 2 : If file 2 does not exist, then file 1 is renamed file 2 But If file 2 exists, it contents are replaced with the contents of file 1
    - -i file 1 file 2 : if file 2 exists, the user is prompted before it is overwritten with the contents of file 1
    - file 1 file 2 dir : The files file 1 and file 2 are moved to dir / dir does not exist, it will exit with an error
    - dir 1 dir 2 : If dir2 does not exist, then dir 1 is renamed dir2 / dir 2 exists, the dir 1 is moved within dir 2
- rm : delete files and directories permantely and irreversevely!!!
    - file 1 file 2 : delete file 1 and file 2
    - -i file 1 file 2 : the user is prompted before each file isi deleted
    - -r dir1 dir2 : directories dir 1 and dir 2 are deleted along with all of their contents
- mkdir dir : make a new directory

### Convenience
